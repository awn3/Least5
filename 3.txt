In a phone interview with The New York Times, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory a first step, but stopped short in expressing confidence that the incoming Democratic administration would have a good working relationship with the party’s left wing.

“We probably paused this precipitous descent,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said, referring to the removal of President Trump. “And the question is, if and how we will build ourselves back up.”

The measured optimism was a sign of the looming fights for Democrats, who experienced a mixed set of results on Election Day. Mr. Biden defeated Mr. Trump by a convincing margin in the Electoral College, but results in several states were more narrow than anticipated. Democrats also lost seats in the House of Representatives and failed to win key Senate races.

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez rejected the idea, espoused by some in her Democratic caucus, that progressive proposals such as “Medicare for all” should be blamed for Democratic losses. She said she thought things like lack of canvassing and digital organizing hurt the party more.

“I think that was the big thing that we learned was that high-turnout elections are not automatically Dem wins,” she said. “But also when we target turnout for us in a very targeted way, then that is absolutely beneficial. I believe we’ve learned we can’t run away from progressive policy. I don’t think it was decisive one way or another.”

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was herself re-elected in New York despite the fact that Republicans had poured millions of dollars into challenging her in the primary and the general election. She said her own experience fending off G.O.P. attacks informs her thinking.

“There’s going to be very effective Republican messaging every single cycle,” she said. “And if you keep trying to play whack-a-mole with this message or that message, you know, you’re never going to be getting ahead.”
